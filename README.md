# shape-features


  * See a simple example of multivariate analysis we use to make feature selection [shape-features](https://github.com/danielaterra/shape-features/tree/main)/[statistical_analysis_for_feature_selection](https://github.com/danielaterra/shape-features/tree/main/statistical_analysis_for_feature_selection/MV_shapeFeatures_versao2.ipynb) .  
   * We have runned the same classification models of this paper ([LastPaperTerra2023.pdf](https://github.com/danielaterra/shape-features/files/15493240/LastPaperTerra2023.pdf)) using 7 selected features for each cell
   * Plain classification - see the results for 2, 3 and 6 classes here [classification_plain.ipynb](https://github.com/danielaterra/shape-features/blob/main/statistical_analysis_for_feature_selection/classification_plain.ipynb)
   * Hierarquical classification - see the results for 2, 3 and 6 classes here [classification_hierarq.ipynb](https://github.com/danielaterra/shape-features/blob/main/statistical_analysis_for_feature_selection/classification_hierarq.ipynb)
